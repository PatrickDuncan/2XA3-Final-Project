# 2XA3 Final Project
The final project for 2XA3 where you had to:
  1. Accept a string of length 1 to 20 inclusive
  2. Check if its all lower case (no numbers/special characters)
  3. Display the string inputed and wait the user to hit enter before continuing
  4. Loop through the inputed string and pass the substrings to a subroutine that computes the longest lyndon substring
  5. Append the computations into a word array
  6. Display the contents of the word array
  
The project had to use NASM and this was uploaded after the final grades were released.
